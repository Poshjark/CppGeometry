# CppGeometry
This program is planned to execute following functions:
1) To manage and edit geometry objects like vectors, polylines and arcs.
2) Make equidistant from geometry objects.
3) Show plot(drawing) of this objects.
4) Generate G-code (My cnc-machine is compatible with .plt extension, so it's preferred)

Though g-code generation is my main subject, because it's not comfortable to open specific applications just to draw few squares or make control program for cutting stripes.
